After a lot of work, I finally finished my Master's thesis. Now, only a little more is left to do before graduating. The thesis is titled "Cluster algebras and where to find them", and can be found [here](https://github.com/WannesMalfait/Cluster-Algebras).

I'm quite surprised at how big of a project it ended up being. When I started in September, I didn't even know what a cluster algebra was. And now, a few months later, I have written a 150-page document on the topic. There is still a lot to read up about, so I'm looking forward to continuing in this field with a Ph.D.
